Look at all the circles
====================

Oh wow, so many circles.

Click the canvas to create a Spawner. The Spawner will spew beautiful circles forever now.

Oh, also, you can only create so many Spawners. The site will slow way down if there are too many circles, ya know?

Oh, you can also press the spacebar to kill off all the spawners!

Yay, so fun!

Okay, time to go to bed.
